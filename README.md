# Embeddable Clock Widget

Simple vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS clock that can be embedded into any website.

## How to Use

1.  Add the following script tag to your HTML file, preferably just before the closing `</body>` tag:

    ```html
    <script src="https://TMHSDigital.github.io/clock-v1/embeddable-clock.js" defer></script>
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username)*

2.  Add the following `div` element where you want the clock to appear in your HTML:

    ```html
    <div id="clock-widget-target"></div>
    ```

That's it! The script will find the target div and inject the clock.

## Live Demo
